## About this project

As most of the businesses are inclined towards better and comfortable solutions and service delivery, various websites are being made for them. Almost every business greatly makes use of the internet today. Realizing this, we have come up with an e-commerce website ‘Laptey’. ‘Laptey’ is a food delivery website with which anyone can order their desired meal and book their table at a restaurant online. Additionally, ‘Laptey’ also helps the restaurant to manage their menu, prices, and other details. The main objective of ‘Laptey’ is to help the restaurant owners to manage their restaurants and the customers to order meals efficiently.
